# dvcrn's sublimetext repo

For packages I patch manually and don't want to push to packagecontrol

## Adding the Repository

`CMD + P -> Package Control: Add Repository` and enter `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvcrn/sublime-repo/master/repository.json`

Alternatively go to your Package Control User settings and add:

```
"repositories":
[
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvcrn/sublime-repo/master/repository.json"
]
```

My version of packages are all prefixed with `dvcrn - ` to not conflict with packagecontrol versions
